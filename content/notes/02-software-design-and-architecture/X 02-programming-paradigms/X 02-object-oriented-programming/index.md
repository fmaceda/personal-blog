The second paradigm to be adopted was actually discovered two years earlier, in 1966, by **Ole Johan Dahl** and **Kristen Nygaard**. These two programmers noticed that the function call stack frame in the ALGOL language could be moved to a heap, thereby allowing local variables declared by a function to exist long after the function returned. The function became a constructor for a class, the local variables became instance variables, and the nested functions became methods. This led inevitably to the discovery of polymorphism through the disciplined use of function pointers.

We can summarize the object-oriented programming paradigm as follows:

> Object-oriented programming imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control.
